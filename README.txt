Summary: This program connects to and retrieve data from 2 web API’s (LastFM and OpenWeather)
using Python’s urllib module. Use transclusion to parse and replace keywords in a journal entry
with content from web API’s. Write classes to manage your APIs. The program also includes all
previous functions from previous assignments, including connecting the ICS32 Distributed Social
and being able to list directories, create and open files, and delete files.

How to Use:
Instructions are pretty simple, the user interface that I made with this program will walk the
user through on what to do and how to access certain things. To see the implemented key words,
you first have to either create or open a DSU file and then create a post, and the user interface
will tell the user about the keywords supported.
